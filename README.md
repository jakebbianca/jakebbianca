- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jake Bianca!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning as much as possible about software engineering and computer programming while I work towards making it a career.
- ðŸŒ± I began my learning journey with Harvard's online self-learning courses CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science and CS50w: Web Programming with Javascript and Python. I have utilized and expanded upon the skills I learned both in personal and professional settings!
